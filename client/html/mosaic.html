                    Hello, my name is Mike Skalandunas and this is my music projectâ€“ <span class="logo">Mosaic</span>. I'm a graduate of Berklee College of Music, and have been working in games, specifically indie game audio, since 2011. In 2012, I worked side-by-side with composer <span class="logo">Filippo Beck-Peccoz</span> to create a wonderful toyshop sample library, and have since been freelancing.  Over the years I've taken on many roles and shipped several titles, learned to <a class="content--link" href="http://riverine.surge.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Riverine">develop</a> audio tools, created hundreds of sounds, and written over one thousand pieces of music.  My goal is to add to the immersion of each project I'm a part of, and to make the journey sound memorable.

                    Below you'll find my mission and some of the projects I've been a part of.  Some are games where I've been the sole composer, some have been collaborations, and others are audio replacements.
